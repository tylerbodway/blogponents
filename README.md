> A Vue.js and CSS Grid experiment with customizable blog components

This project was my own experimentation while
trying to learn both CSS Grid Layout, as well
as setting up Vue.js projects

My goal was to come up with repeatable
componentized content blocks, that could be easily
rendered based on external CMS content.

A beautiful, modern blog layout, boiled down to it's
essential blocks to help content
writers add/update with as little settings as possible.
